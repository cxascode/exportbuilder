# CX as Code Bundler (Beta)

**Live app:** [https://cxascode.github.io/bundler/](https://cxascode.github.io/bundler/)

Bundle pipeline exports without hand-maintaining dependency wiring.

Bundler is a small React app built on **Genesys Spark** (`gux-*` components) that produces a ready-to-wear `genesyscloud_tf_export` block for CX as Code pipelines. It seeds `include_filter_resources`, suggests `replace_with_datasource` patterns from the Genesys Cloud dependency tree, and sets the cxascode-friendly defaults (`enable_dependency_resolution`, HCL export, and related settings). You tailor the rest — named regex filters, org-specific replace patterns, and anything beyond the starter.

## Why Bundler?

Writing a correct `genesyscloud_tf_export` block by hand means juggling three things at once:

- Which resource types to **include** as export seeds
- Which related types should become **data sources** instead of managed resources
- Which provider settings the cxascode pipeline expects

Bundler handles the boilerplate so you can focus on the org-specific parts.

## Modes

### Catalog

Pick resource types from the live Genesys Cloud dependency catalog (with a bundled fallback for offline use). Bundler:

- Expands selected types into `include_filter_resources` using the dependency tree
- Derives first-level dependencies
- Suggests `replace_with_datasource` entries as `type::.*` for those dependencies
- Sets `use_legacy_architect_flow_exporter` when flows appear only as dependencies

Catalog mode also tracks which types are assigned across bundles so you do not double-assign the same resource type.

### Paste

Paste whole resource types, one per line. Bundler normalizes each line to a bare type for `include_filter_resources` and builds replace suggestions from first-level dependencies. Paste mode is for when you already know the include list and do not need the catalog picker.

## Example output

```hcl
resource "genesyscloud_tf_export" "tf_export" {
  directory                          = "./genesyscloud"
  enable_dependency_resolution       = true
  export_format                      = "hcl"
  exclude_attributes                 = []
  include_state_file                 = false
  include_filter_resources           = [
    "genesyscloud_queue",
    "genesyscloud_routing_queue"
  ]
  log_permission_errors              = true
  replace_with_datasource            = [
    "genesyscloud_division::.*",
    "genesyscloud_user::.*"
  ]
  split_files_by_resource            = false
  use_legacy_architect_flow_exporter = false
}
```

Copy the generated block from the app, drop it into your cxascode repo, and adjust from there.

## Workspace files

Export and import `bundler-workspace.json` to save bundles, switch between catalog versions, and share work with others before committing Terraform.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

This repo includes `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

1. Push to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Set **Build and deployment → Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Push to `main`, or run the workflow manually from **Actions**.

### Base path

For a project site at `https://<org>.github.io/<repo>/`, the workflow derives the Vite base path from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.

For a custom domain or root deployment:

```bash
VITE_BASE_PATH=/
```
